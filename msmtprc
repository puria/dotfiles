# This file configures msmtp, a program for sending emails over SMTP
# I have two accounts, one dyne, and one for work
# Which account is used in mutt is determined by the value of the `sendmail` 
# setting, which is changed dynamically based on the current folder
# See mutt/hooks and mutt/accounts/*

# These settings apply to all accounts
